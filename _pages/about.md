Hi, I'm Nəriman

## Developer experience
I have successfully completed numerous community-driven coding projects, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and practical application of my skills. As a self-taught developer, my areas of expertise include JavaScript and TypeScript, specializing in creating Discord bots, and entry-level Python for writing Wikipedia scripts. Visit my GitHub profile for more information.

## Wikipedian experience
Since 2017, I have been a dedicated volunteer for Wikimedia projects. I am privileged to hold the roles of administrator and interface administrator in the Azerbaijani Wikipedia, where I have made a significant contribution of 58,000+ edits. My extensive experience as a Wikipedia editor and administrator has given me a deep understanding of Wikipedia’s policies, a commitment to collaborative editing, and a dedication to upholding the platform's integrity. This experience makes me a valuable asset for any project that requires expertise in content creation, community engagement, and administrative responsibilities within the Wikipedia ecosystem.
